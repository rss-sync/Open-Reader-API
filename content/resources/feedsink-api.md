## Use Cases

### As a client, I was just launched, so I want to retrieve all the changes the user made since the last time I checked

#### Request

* Send a GET request to the resource “a user’s changes since {date-time}”
    * example path: `/users/{user-id}/changes-since-2013-03-18T21:34:22-04:00`
* The request header `Accept` must be `application/json; schema=feedsink.user-changes.v.1.0`

#### Success Response

* The response header `Content-Type` will be `application/json; schema=feedsink.user-changes.v1.0`

The response entity will be a JSON object which looks like this:

    {
        "feeds": {
            "added": [
                {
                    uri: "http://aviflax.com/feed",
                    name: "Avi’s Rad Blog",
                    "tags": ["racing" "friends"]
                },
                {

### As a client, I just downloaded new entries from one of a user’s feeds, and I want to check whether any of them have been read already, so that I don’t show the user entries they already read

#### Request

* Send a GET request to the resource “a user’s read entries for feed {uri}”
    * example path: `/users/{user-id}/feeds/{uri}/entries/read`
* The request header `Accept` must be `application/json; schema=feedsink.read-entries.v1.0`

#### Success Response

* The response header `Content-Type` will be `application/json; schema=feedsink.read-entries.v1.0`

The response entity will be a JSON object which looks like this:

    {
        "read_entries": [
            'urn:uuid:1225c695-cfb8-4ebb-aaaa-80da344efa6a',
            'urn:uuid:1225c695-cfb8-4ebb-aaaa-80da344efa6a',
            'urn:uuid:1225c695-cfb8-4ebb-aaaa-80da344efa6a'
        ]
    }


#### Error Responses

### Set the read/unread/starred/unstarred status for entries from one of a user’s feeds

* so their status is the preserved if they switch to a different device or app

#### Request

* Send a POST request to the resource “a user’s entries for feed {uri}”
    * example path: `/users/{user-id}/feeds/{uri}/entries`
* The value of the request header `Content-Type` must be `application/json; schema=feedsink.statuschanges.v1.0`

The request entity should be a JSON object which looks like this:

    {
        "read": [
            // tuples of entry_id and user_action_date
            [

                'urn:uuid:1225c695-cfb8-4ebb-aaaa-80da344efa6a',
                '2013-03-12T23:22:11-04:00'
            ]
        ],  
        "unread": [
            // tuples of entry_id and user_action_date
            [
                'urn:uuid:1225c695-cfb8-4ebb-aaaa-80da344efa6a',
                '2013-03-12T23:22:11-04:00'

                '2013-03-12T23:22:11-04:00'
            ]
        ],
        "starred": [
            // tuples of entry_id and user_action_date
            [
                'urn:uuid:1225c695-cfb8-4ebb-aaaa-80da344efa6a',
                '2013-03-12T23:22:11-04:00'
            ],
            [
                'urn:uuid:1225c695-cfb8-4ebb-aaaa-80da344efa6a',
                '2013-03-12T23:22:11-04:00'
            ]
        ],

                '2013-03-12T23:22:11-04:00'
            ],

                'urn:uuid:1225c695-cfb8-4ebb-aaaa-80da344efa6a',
                '2013-03-12T23:22:11-04:00'
            ]
        ],
    }


* The entity should not include all entries for the feed, rather only those which the client wishes to set the status of
* `user_action_date` is included so the service can discard user actions which it recieves out of order.
* The elements of the arrays `read` and `unread` are tuples rather than objects so as to minimize data size
    * mobile clients will be uploading this representation and it’s important to try to keep the uploads small
    * most (maybe all) HTTP client libraries don’t support compressing request entities

#### Success Response

* If the request is successful, you will receive either a 204 or 202 response

#### Error Responses
TBD


### Retrieve the list of all of a user’s feeds

* Each feed should include a list of the N most recent read entries so they can be filtered out without making a ton of additional requests

#### Request

* Send a GET request to the resource “a user’s feeds”
    * example path: `/users/{user-id}/feeds`
* The request header `Accept` must be `application/json; schema=feedsink.feed-list.v1.0`

#### Success Response

The response header `Content-Type` will be `application/json; schema=feedsink.feed-list.v1.0`

The response entity will be a JSON object which looks like this:

    {
        "feeds": [
            {
                "uri": "http://aviflax.com/feed",

                    'urn:uuid:1225c695-cfb8-4ebb-aaaa-80da344efa6a',
                    'urn:uuid:1225c695-cfb8-4ebb-aaaa-80da344efa6a'
                ]
            },
            {
                "uri": "http://arc90.com/feed",

                    'urn:uuid:1225c695-cfb8-4ebb-aaaa-80da344efa6a',
                    'urn:uuid:1225c695-cfb8-4ebb-aaaa-80da344efa6a'
                ]
            }
        ]
    }

#### Error Responses
TBD


### Add a feed to a user’s list of feeds

#### Request

* Send a PUT request to the resource “the feed {uri} of a user”
    * example path: `/users/{user-id}/feeds/{feed-uri}`
* The request header `Content-Type` must be `application/json; schema=feedsink.feed.v1.0`

The request entity should be a JSON object which looks like this:

    {
        "uri": "http://aviflax.com/feed",
        "name": "Avi’s Silly Blog",
        "tags": ["river", "arc/staff"],
    }

Please note that a tag may contain `/` to denote that it is heirarchical.

#### Success Response

* The status code will be either 201 or 202
* There will be no entity

#### Error Responses
* TBD


### Remove a feed from a user’s list of feeds

#### Request

* Send a DELETE request to the resource “the feed {uri} of user {user-id}”
    * example path: `/users/{user-id}/feeds/{feed-uri}`
* The request header [`If-Unmodified-Since`](http://www.w3.org/Protocols/rfc2616/rfc2616-sec14.html#sec14.28) must be included
    * the value should be the date-time at which the user initiated the deletion

#### Success Response

* The status code will be either 202 or 204
* There will be no entity

#### Error Responses
TBD


### Add multiple feeds to a user’s list of feeds

* This is intended for the “import” use-case wherein a user is adopting the API for the first time, and wishes to import their feed list from another application or service
* Clients are recommended to use this method only when they have a significant number of feeds to add at once
    * Otherwise, PUT requests to the resource “the feed {uri} of user {user-id}” are recommended, as they are idempotent and therefore less likely to result in an undesired outcome, as in the case of an error they can be safely resent

#### Request

* Send a POST request to the resouce “a user’s feeds”
    * example path: `/users/{user-id}/feeds`
* The request header `Content-Type` must be `application/json; schema=feedsink.feed-list.v1.0`

The request entity should be a JSON object which looks like this:

    {
        "feeds": [
            {
                "uri": "http://aviflax.com/feed",
                "name": "Avi’s Silly Blog",
                "tags": ["favorites"]
            },
            {
                "uri": "http://arc90.com/feed",
                "name": "Arc90 Blog",
                "tags": ["river", "arc"]
            }
        ]
    }

#### Success Response

* The status code will be either 200, 202, or 204
* There will be no entity

#### Error Responses
* TBD


### Change the name or tags of a user’s feed

#### Request

* Send a PUT request to the resource “the feed {uri} of a user”
    * example path: `/users/{user-id}/feeds/{feed-uri}`
* The request header `Content-Type` must be `application/json; schema=feedsink.feed.v1.0`
* The request header [`If-Unmodified-Since`](http://www.w3.org/Protocols/rfc2616/rfc2616-sec14.html#sec14.28) must be included
    * the value should be the date-time at which the user entered the changes

The request entity should be a JSON object which looks like this:

    {
        "uri": "http://aviflax.com/feed",
        "name": "Avi’s Silly Blog",
        "tags": ["river", "arc/staff"],
    }

* A tag may contain `/` to denote that it is heirarchical
* If the value of `uri` does not match the path segment `feed-uri` of the target resource URI path, the request will be rejected

#### Success Response

* The status code will be 200 or 202
* There will be no entity

#### Error Responses
TBD
