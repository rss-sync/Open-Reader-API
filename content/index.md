## Get involved

1. **[Voice your support](http://rss-sync.github.io/Open-Reader-API/rssconsensus)**. This endeavor requires broad support. It will only work if all major feed syncing platforms decide to cooperate on a new protocol. First step is to agree, that we are all working our way towards the same common goal.
2. **[Join the mailing list](http://lists.ranchero.com/listinfo.cgi/rss-sync-ranchero.com)** and the discussion. It keeps you up-to-date. Plenty of good ideas have already been put forth and the discussions are well away.
3. **[Contribute](https://github.com/rss-sync/Open-Reader-API)**. How should the specifications look? *Well, that's for the developers of the protocol and **you** to decide.* All submissions are encouraged. To submit a change, fork [this repository](https://github.com/rss-sync/Open-Reader-API), commit your changes and send a [pull request](https://help.github.com/articles/using-pull-requests).
